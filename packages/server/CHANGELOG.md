## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 05ecf90: **Breaking:** Split declarative `DashboardConfig` from runtime `Connector` instances.

  `DashboardConfig.connectors` is now an array of declarative entries (`{ name, connectorId, config, syncIntervalSeconds?, enabled?, displayName? }`) instead of `{ connector: Connector }` wrappers around live instances. Connector implementations are wired separately via a `connectorRegistry` option on `mountEngine`, `createSyncRouter`, `createEngine`, and `triggerSync` (in-process mode). `secretsResolver` is exposed as the same per-deployment channel.

  Migration:

  ```ts
  // before
  const github = new GitHubConnector(
    { owner: 'acme', repo: 'web' },
    { token: secret('GH_TOKEN') },
  );
  mountEngine(
    defineConfig({
      connectors: [{ connector: github }],
      dashboards: { /* ... */ },
    }),
    { storage },
  );

  // after
  const github = {
    name: 'main',
    connectorId: 'github-actions',
    config: { owner: 'acme', repo: 'web', token: secret('GH_TOKEN') },
  };
  mountEngine(
    defineConfig({
      connectors: [github],
      dashboards: { /* ... */ },
    }),
    {
      connectorRegistry: { 'github-actions': GitHubConnector },
      storage,
    },
  );
  ```

  Same config object now works in-process, in deferred-runner mode, and in cloud. `resolveWidget` accepts `readonly string[] | undefined` (connector instance names) instead of the previous `ConfiguredConnector[] | string[]` union. `toWireConfig` is now a near-identity passthrough; the wire format is the in-memory shape.

- 686da2b: Populate `CachedWidget.syncState` and `CachedWidget.meta` from per-connector health.

  `WidgetSyncState` is now `'fresh' | 'stale' | 'unsynced' | 'syncing' | 'failing'` — the previous `'synced'` / `'error'` variants are gone (they were declared in the wire types but never populated, so no consumer should depend on them).

  `StorageHandle` gains an optional `getHealth?(): Promise<ConnectorHealth | null>` accessor, and `ConnectorHealth` is exported from `@rawdash/core` and re-exported from `@rawdash/server`. `resolveWidget` calls it to derive `syncState` and `meta.connectorStatus` per widget, falling back to `fresh|unsynced` from the resolved data when health is absent. `CachedWidget.cachedAt` is now sourced from the connector's `lastSyncAt` instead of the global `SyncState.lastSyncAt`.

  `InMemoryStorage` implements `getHealth()` with a minimal shape — `lastSyncAt` is the last write timestamp per connector, `syncIntervalSeconds: 0`. Cloud / libSQL adapters that track per-connector status can implement `getHealth()` to surface rich `failing` / `syncing` states; adapters that don't implement it still get a `syncState` fallback (`'fresh'` when data exists, `'unsynced'` otherwise) but no `meta`.

### Patch Changes

- 09f4ed8: Add deferred-runner mode to `triggerSync` (`@rawdash/server`) and `createSyncRouter` (`@rawdash/hono`). Pass `mode: 'deferred'` to skip `runSync` and the `getConfig` call — the handler only persists the `queued` transition, leaving `running → succeeded/failed` to an external runner (e.g. a queue consumer worker). Default `mode: 'in-process'` keeps existing behavior unchanged.
- 479ca27: Add an optional `WidgetCache` hook to `listWidgets` / `getWidget` (`@rawdash/server`) and `createWidgetsRouter` (`@rawdash/hono`). Deployments can plug in any cache (in-memory LRU, KV, Redis, …) without forking the resolver; the impl owns TTL, eviction, and the backing store. When omitted, behavior is unchanged. `createWidgetsRouter` accepts a `cache: (c: Context) => WidgetCache` factory invoked once per request, so the cache can be scoped to the request's tenant/auth context. Cache errors are isolated — `get` failures fall through to fresh resolution, `set` failures are logged via `console.warn`.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 6912896: **Breaking.** Redesigned the sync/health wire contract and split `@rawdash/server` into a framework-agnostic core (pure handlers, engine, types) and a new `@rawdash/hono` adapter package.

  ### Wire contract (breaking)
  - `GET /health` now returns `{status: 'ok'}` — liveness only, no storage access.
  - New `GET /sync/state` returns the sync projection (the data `/health` used to return).
  - `POST /sync` returns `{queued: true|false}` immediately; it never blocks waiting for the sync to finish.
  - `SyncState.status` is now `'idle' | 'queued' | 'running' | 'succeeded' | 'failed'`, with new `queuedAt` and `startedAt` fields. (Was: `'idle' | 'syncing' | 'error'`.)

  Migrate clients to poll `/sync/state` instead of `/health`. `@rawdash/client.ensureFresh` does this automatically.

  ### Package changes (breaking)
  - `@rawdash/server` no longer depends on Hono. It exports pure handler functions (`listWidgets`, `getWidget`, `triggerSync`, `getSyncStateHandler`, `getHealth`, `runRetentionOnce`), an `EngineContext` interface, `ROUTES` constants, the `RawdashError` class, and the engine (`createEngine`, `runSync`, `runRetention`). `serve()` is gone.
  - **New `@rawdash/hono` package** — Hono router factories (`createWidgetsRouter`, `createSyncRouter`, `createSyncStateRouter`, `createHealthRouter`, `createRetentionRouter`) and a `mountEngine` convenience. This is the only package with a `hono` dependency now, and it ships no Node-specific code.
  - `ServerStorage` methods renamed: `setSyncing` → `markSyncRunning`, `setSyncSuccess` → `markSyncSucceeded`, `setSyncError` → `markSyncFailed`. New `markSyncQueued()` method.
  - `@rawdash/client` data sources gained `getSyncState()`. `getHealth()` now returns `{status:'ok'}` only. `ensureFresh` polls `/sync/state` and throws fast on unrecognized status values (no more 30s deadlocks on contract mismatches).

  ### Migration

  Replace `import { serve } from '@rawdash/server'` with:

  ```ts
  import { serve as honoServe } from '@hono/node-server';
  import { mountEngine } from '@rawdash/hono';

  const { app } = mountEngine(config, { storage });
  honoServe({ fetch: app.fetch, port: 8080 });
  ```

  Replace storage method calls:

  ```ts
  // before
  await storage.setSyncing();
  await storage.setSyncSuccess();
  await storage.setSyncError('boom');

  // after
  await storage.markSyncRunning();
  await storage.markSyncSucceeded();
  await storage.markSyncFailed('boom');
  ```

  If you were calling `GET /health` to read sync state, switch to `GET /sync/state`. `@rawdash/client` users get this for free.

  ### Other
  - `@rawdash/adapter-libsql` adds migration `0002_milky_echo` (two `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` statements for `queued_at` and `started_at`). Applies automatically on first run; safe on populated databases.
  - The libsql migrations bundle script now runs Prettier internally so the output is byte-stable across runs. A new CI step (`pnpm --filter @rawdash/adapter-libsql db:bundle && git diff --exit-code`) catches stale bundles.
  - `@rawdash/mcp`'s `trigger_sync` tool uses the new storage methods.
  - `@rawdash/nextjs.createRawdashClient` polls `/sync/state` (via the underlying data source) instead of `/health`.

### Patch Changes

- 8e217a5: Cancellable per-run storage handles. `ServerStorage.getStorageHandle()` now accepts an optional `{ signal: AbortSignal }`; when the signal aborts, every subsequent write on the returned `StorageHandle` becomes a no-op with a single `console.warn`. The HTTP `/sync` route wires the per-connector timeout controller through, so a connector that times out can no longer leak tail writes into the next sync run even if it ignores its own `AbortSignal`. Reads on the handle are unaffected. `InMemoryStorage` and `LibsqlStorage` apply the wrapping automatically; external `ServerStorage` implementations get the same behavior for free if they forward the option (or by composing with the exported `withAbortSignal(handle, signal)` helper).

### Minor Changes

- 7adee87: Consolidate HTTP wire-format types in `@rawdash/core` so the server and any other backend implementation (including the hosted cloud) can typecheck against the same response contract the SDK consumes. Two production bugs in the last week traced back to silent OSS↔cloud drift; one canonical home eliminates the class.

  New module `@rawdash/core/wire` exports:
  - `CachedWidget<TData = unknown>` — was `CachedWidgetData` in `@rawdash/client`; consolidated with the old `CachedWidget` from `@rawdash/core/engine`. Now generic, `data: TData | null`, optional `syncState`/`meta`. The dead duplicate `id` field is removed (it was always set to the same value as `widgetId`).
  - `WidgetsListResponse` — `{ widgets: CachedWidget[] }` envelope returned by `GET /dashboards/:id/widgets`.
  - `TriggerSyncResponse` — `{ triggered: boolean }`, renamed from the old `SyncResult` in `@rawdash/client` to resolve the name collision with `SyncResult` from `@rawdash/core/connector` (which is a connector-iteration result, not an HTTP response).
  - `WidgetSyncState` — moved from `@rawdash/client`.
  - `DataSource`, `ServerDataSource` — moved from `@rawdash/client`.

  Breaking:
  - `@rawdash/client` no longer exports `CachedWidgetData`, `HealthStatus`, `SyncResult` (for the HTTP-trigger response), `WidgetSyncState`, `DataSource`, `ServerDataSource`. Import from `@rawdash/core` instead. `HealthStatus` has been removed entirely — it was identical to `SyncState`, which already lived in `@rawdash/core`.
  - `@rawdash/nextjs` no longer re-exports those types; import from `@rawdash/core`.
  - `@rawdash/server` no longer re-exports `SyncState`/`CachedWidget`; import from `@rawdash/core`.
  - `CachedWidget.id` removed.
  - `resolveWidget`'s first parameter is now named `widgetId` (was `id`) — call sites unchanged behaviorally.

  Consumers of the SDK that only use the `http()` / `createRawdashClient()` factories see no runtime change; only import paths for type-only references need updating.

- d4a0db3: `GET /dashboards/:id/widgets` now returns a `{ widgets: CachedWidgetData[] }` envelope instead of a bare top-level array. This leaves room to add sibling metadata (pagination cursors, sync state, error envelopes, etc.) without another breaking change.

  The `@rawdash/client` SDK (`http().getWidgets()`) unwraps `.widgets` internally, so consumers using the SDK still receive `CachedWidgetData[]` and need no changes. Anyone calling the HTTP endpoint directly (without the SDK) needs to read from the `widgets` field.

### Patch Changes

- e42e3f8: Republish packages with `workspace:*` deps rewritten to real semver ranges. The publish workflow regressed in #59 and was emitting `"workspace:*"` literally into published `package.json` files, breaking installs for external consumers. The script now uses `pnpm publish` (which packs through pnpm's workspace-aware path) instead of `npm publish` directly.

### Minor Changes

- 6fb7a7d: Consolidate libSQL storage into `@rawdash/adapter-libsql`.
  - New package `@rawdash/adapter-libsql` exporting `LibsqlStorage`, a `ServerStorage` backed by libSQL/Turso via Kysely. Works on Node and Cloudflare Workers from the same package.
  - Built-in schema migrations: Drizzle schema is the source of truth for `drizzle-kit generate`; runtime applies inlined SQL via a tiny applier (no `fs` / `fileURLToPath`, so Workers-safe).
  - Removed `@rawdash/core/libsql` subpath export — use `@rawdash/adapter-libsql` instead.
  - Removed `@rawdash/adapter-turso` — replaced by `@rawdash/adapter-libsql`.

- 9de7a5d: Rename public API types/interfaces/classes for clearer framework ergonomics. Drops noisy suffixes like `Ref`, `Entry`, `Def`, `Response`, and disambiguates several `Metric`-related types.

  Breaking renames:
  - `SecretRef` → `Secret` (and `isSecretRef` → `isSecret`, `resolveSecretRefs` → `resolveSecrets`)
  - `Metric` (data sample) → `MetricSample`
  - `MetricDef` → `Metric`
  - `ResolvedMetric` → `ComputedMetric` (and `resolvedMetricSchema` → `computedMetricSchema`)
  - `ConnectorEntry` → `ConfiguredConnector`
  - `WidgetEntry` → `CachedWidget`
  - `SyncRequest` → `SyncOptions`
  - `RawdashRouter` → `RouterMount`
  - `RawdashEngine` (client) → `ServerDataSource`
  - `RawdashClient` (nextjs) — removed; use `DataSource` directly
  - `RetryOptions` → `RetryPolicy`
  - `CredentialEntry` → `CredentialField`
  - `CredentialSchema` → `CredentialsSchema`
  - `RetentionCandidates` → `RetentionDeletionPlan`
  - `McpError` → `McpErrorPayload`
  - `RuntimeConfig` (mcp) → `McpRuntime`
  - `DiffSet<T>` → `Diff<T>`
  - `CloudConnectorEntry` → `CloudConnectorRecord`
  - `CloudDashboardEntry` → `CloudDashboardRecord`
  - `SecretEntry` → `CloudSecret`
  - `CloudConfigBody` → `CloudConfig`
  - `CachedWidgetResponse` → `CachedWidgetData`
  - `HealthResponse` → `HealthStatus`
  - `SyncTriggerResponse` → `SyncResult`

- 725ea8a: Extract the widget engine into a runtime-neutral module in `@rawdash/core`.
  - `computeMetric`, `resolveWidget`, `InMemoryStorage`, and the `ServerStorage` interface now live in `@rawdash/core` and are re-exported from `@rawdash/server` for back-compat.
  - New `@rawdash/core/libsql` subpath export ships a `LibsqlStorage` adapter built on `@libsql/client/web` — runtime-neutral and Worker-compatible (no Node APIs, no drizzle migrator).
  - `widgetSchemas` (and new `widgetSchema`, `resolvedMetricSchema`, `filterClauseSchema`, `groupBySchema`, etc.) now describe the actual rich `Widget` discriminated union instead of using a placeholder `metric: z.string()`.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 0f069f7: **Breaking change**: `defineConfig()` no longer accepts a flat `widgets` map. Widgets are now grouped under named dashboards via `defineDashboard()`.

  **Before:**

  ```ts
  defineConfig({
    connectors: [{ connector: github }],
    widgets: {
      run_count: { metric: defineMetric({ ... }) },
    },
  });
  ```

  **After:**

  ```ts
  defineConfig({
    connectors: [{ connector: github }],
    dashboards: {
      github: defineDashboard({
        widgets: {
          run_count: { metric: defineMetric({ ... }) },
        },
      }),
    },
  });
  ```

  The widgets HTTP API is now dashboard-scoped: `GET /widgets` and `GET /widgets/:id` have been replaced by `GET /dashboards/:dashboardId/widgets` and `GET /dashboards/:dashboardId/widgets/:widgetId`. Widget IDs remain bare keys within their dashboard (e.g. `run_count_7d`); the dashboard is expressed via the URL path.
