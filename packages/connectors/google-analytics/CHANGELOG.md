# @rawdash/connector-google-analytics

## 0.13.0

### Patch Changes

- 04d849e: Add `default` export pointing at the connector class on every `@rawdash/connector-*` package. Enables symbol-name-agnostic build-time codegen for rawdash cloud's connector registry. Existing named exports (`GitHubConnector`, `StripeConnector`, `GA4Connector`) are unchanged.
- Updated dependencies [27254b6]
  - @rawdash/core@0.13.0

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 7139c61: Unify the `static create(input, ctx?)` signature across all connectors so the hosted cloud sync-consumer can register them through a single collapsed registry instead of per-connector adapters.
  - `GitHubActionsConnector.create`, `StripeConnector.create`, `GA4Connector.create` now all take an optional `ConnectorContext` as the second argument and forward it to the constructor. This is the hook the cloud uses to attach a per-sync request observer (RAW-279) without a per-connector adapter knowing how to split raw config into `(settings, creds)`.
  - `StripeConnector.create` and `GA4Connector.create` now return the connector instance directly instead of `{ connector }`. `GitHubActionsConnector.create` already did this; the three are now consistent.
  - `ConnectorFactory.create` in `@rawdash/mcp` is correspondingly typed `(settings: unknown) => Connector` (was `=> ConfiguredConnector`); the `add_connector` tool wraps the bare connector into the `{ connector }` shape that `DashboardConfig.connectors` still uses.

  Breaking:
  - Callers of `StripeConnector.create({...}).connector` or `GA4Connector.create({...}).connector` should drop the `.connector` destructure — `create()` now returns the connector itself.
  - `ConnectorFactory.create` implementations that returned `{ connector }` should return the bare `Connector` instance instead.

### Minor Changes

- Initial release of `@rawdash/connector-google-analytics` — a GA4 connector that syncs traffic by day, traffic by source/medium, top pages, events, conversions, and geo data into the six-shape storage model using the GA4 Data API. Authentication supports both Google service accounts (JSON key) and OAuth 2.0 refresh tokens. All six resources are stored as `metric` samples with full dimension and metric attributes available for filtering and aggregation. Backfill (90-day default) and incremental (30-day rolling) sync modes are both supported, with offset-based pagination resumable via cursor.
