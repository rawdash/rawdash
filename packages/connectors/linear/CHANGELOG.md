### Patch Changes

- 66d2e20: Accelerate Linear syncs. Flat resources (teams/users/cycles) now page at 250 items (up from 50) and issues page at 150, cutting the number of round-trips several-fold. The issues page size is automatically capped against the nested per-issue history depth so larger pages don't trip Linear's GraphQL query-complexity limit, and the default `historyPerIssue` is lowered from 25 to 8 to keep the combined query cheap (still tunable, and incremental syncs append newer transitions across runs). Page sizes also honour the new `SyncOptions.pageSize` (clamped to Linear's 250 max). Pagination now pipelines page fetches with storage writes and yields a resumable cursor on a soft 25s per-chunk budget.
- fc7e0d0: Remove non-essential code comments (section dividers, section labels, and explanatory comments) across the codebase. No behavior change; published output is unaffected.

### Minor Changes

- 022cbf1: Connectors now emit structured INFO progress logs during sync.

  Adds a `ConnectorLogger` interface (`info` / `warn`) exposed on `ConnectorContext` and accessible via `this.logger` on `BaseConnector`. The default implementation writes single-line, key=value formatted records to stdout/stderr with a stable `[<scope>]` prefix.

  `paginateChunked` now emits one INFO line per page fetch (`fetched page resource=… page=… items=… cursor=…`), one per resource completion (`resource done resource=… pages=… items=… duration_ms=…`), and a WARN line when a page fetch or batch write fails. `runSync` wraps each connector run in `[runner] sync started` / `[runner] sync settled status=… duration_ms=…` envelopes.

  All five OSS connectors (github, sentry, linear, stripe, vercel) pass `this.logger` into `paginateChunked`, so a multi-minute sync now produces a continuous, parseable stream of progress lines instead of silence between queued and succeeded.

  Operators can BYO logger by passing `loggerFactory: (scope) => ConnectorLogger` to `mountEngine`, `createSyncRouter`, `createEngine`, `triggerSync`, or `runSync` directly. The factory is invoked with `'runner'` for the runner envelopes and with each connector instance name for that connector's logger; omit it to keep the default stdout impl.

### Patch Changes

- a1c4c66: Extract shared connector boilerplate across six connectors. No behavior change for connector consumers; everything below is internal refactor.
  - `@rawdash/core` gains `makeChunkedCursorGuard(phases)`, `selectActivePhases(resourceToPhase, order, enabled)`, and `BaseConnector.isResourceEnabled<R>(resource)`. These replace hand-rolled copies that had accumulated across vercel/sentry/linear/stripe/github.
  - The internal `@rawdash/connector-shared` substrate gains `standardRateLimitPolicy({ remainingHeader, resetHeader, resetUnit, resetFallbackMs? })`, `sanitizeAllowedUrl({ url, host, pathname, protocol? })`, `parseEpoch(value, 'ms' | 's' | 'iso')`, and `connectorUserAgent(id)`. The vendor-named `githubRateLimit` / `sentryRateLimit` / `linearRateLimit` exports are gone — each connector now builds its policy from `standardRateLimitPolicy`, including vercel which previously rolled its own.
  - Property-test fetch-mock scaffolding (`mockResponse`, `installFetchMock`, `entityStoreFor`, `eventStoreFor`, `metricStoreFor`) was duplicated byte-for-byte in every connector's `property.test.ts`; it now lives in `@rawdash/connector-test-utils`.

  Net effect for downstream packages: identical behavior, ~200 fewer lines per connector, one place to fix when the substrate evolves.

- d52a6a8: Scope OSS sync to widget-driven backfill windows.

  `runSync` previously called every configured connector with `mode: 'full'` and no `since`, so connectors paginated all of upstream history on every sync — blowing past the 1000-chunk safety cap on real-world repos and making the example dashboards un-syncable.

  `computeConnectorBackfill` (new in `@rawdash/core`) walks `config.dashboards.*.widgets`, groups them by connector name, and computes the max window per connector. Status widgets count as references; current-state widgets with no window keep the connector in the map but leave the window undefined.

  `runSync` now skips connectors with zero referencing widgets, and passes `since = now − requiredWindow − 1d buffer` whenever a window is present.

  The GitHub connector honors `since` on `pull_requests` (sorted by `updated` desc and stopping at the cutoff), `deployments`, and `releases`. Sentry, Linear, Stripe, Vercel, and Google Analytics also honor `since` under `mode: 'full'` so the widget-driven window flows end-to-end. Stripe subscriptions are intentionally exempt from the `created[gte]` cutoff in full mode because subscription `updated_at` is derived from `current_period_end` and a still-active subscription created before the cutoff would otherwise be dropped.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 1ad2bc0: Enforce `static schemas` on every connector via the `ConnectorClass` contract.

  `ConnectorClass` in `@rawdash/core` now requires a `readonly schemas: Readonly<Record<string, z.ZodType>>` map of resource name → Zod schema describing the raw API response shape. The keys must match the `resource` tag passed to `request()`. Building a `ConnectorRegistry` with a connector class that lacks `schemas` is now a TypeScript compile error.

  The cloud baseline generator walks this map at deploy time to populate `connector_baselines`, which drives the shape-drift detection pipeline. Without `schemas`, the generator skipped every connector and the pipeline sat dormant; enforcing it at the type level prevents that from happening again.

  All four shipping OSS connectors (`@rawdash/connector-github`, `@rawdash/connector-stripe`, `@rawdash/connector-linear`, `@rawdash/connector-google-analytics`) and `@rawdash/connector-sentry` now expose `static schemas` matching their full resource set. Property tests in each connector consume schemas via `runPropertySyncTest({ connectorClass, resource })`, so a dropped or misnamed key breaks that connector's own property tests in addition to failing typecheck at the registry site.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 6912896: **Breaking.** Redesigned the sync/health wire contract and split `@rawdash/server` into a framework-agnostic core (pure handlers, engine, types) and a new `@rawdash/hono` adapter package.

  ### Wire contract (breaking)
  - `GET /health` now returns `{status: 'ok'}` — liveness only, no storage access.
  - New `GET /sync/state` returns the sync projection (the data `/health` used to return).
  - `POST /sync` returns `{queued: true|false}` immediately; it never blocks waiting for the sync to finish.
  - `SyncState.status` is now `'idle' | 'queued' | 'running' | 'succeeded' | 'failed'`, with new `queuedAt` and `startedAt` fields. (Was: `'idle' | 'syncing' | 'error'`.)

  Migrate clients to poll `/sync/state` instead of `/health`. `@rawdash/client.ensureFresh` does this automatically.

  ### Package changes (breaking)
  - `@rawdash/server` no longer depends on Hono. It exports pure handler functions (`listWidgets`, `getWidget`, `triggerSync`, `getSyncStateHandler`, `getHealth`, `runRetentionOnce`), an `EngineContext` interface, `ROUTES` constants, the `RawdashError` class, and the engine (`createEngine`, `runSync`, `runRetention`). `serve()` is gone.
  - **New `@rawdash/hono` package** — Hono router factories (`createWidgetsRouter`, `createSyncRouter`, `createSyncStateRouter`, `createHealthRouter`, `createRetentionRouter`) and a `mountEngine` convenience. This is the only package with a `hono` dependency now, and it ships no Node-specific code.
  - `ServerStorage` methods renamed: `setSyncing` → `markSyncRunning`, `setSyncSuccess` → `markSyncSucceeded`, `setSyncError` → `markSyncFailed`. New `markSyncQueued()` method.
  - `@rawdash/client` data sources gained `getSyncState()`. `getHealth()` now returns `{status:'ok'}` only. `ensureFresh` polls `/sync/state` and throws fast on unrecognized status values (no more 30s deadlocks on contract mismatches).

  ### Migration

  Replace `import { serve } from '@rawdash/server'` with:

  ```ts
  import { serve as honoServe } from '@hono/node-server';
  import { mountEngine } from '@rawdash/hono';

  const { app } = mountEngine(config, { storage });
  honoServe({ fetch: app.fetch, port: 8080 });
  ```

  Replace storage method calls:

  ```ts
  // before
  await storage.setSyncing();
  await storage.setSyncSuccess();
  await storage.setSyncError('boom');

  // after
  await storage.markSyncRunning();
  await storage.markSyncSucceeded();
  await storage.markSyncFailed('boom');
  ```

  If you were calling `GET /health` to read sync state, switch to `GET /sync/state`. `@rawdash/client` users get this for free.

  ### Other
  - `@rawdash/adapter-libsql` adds migration `0002_milky_echo` (two `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` statements for `queued_at` and `started_at`). Applies automatically on first run; safe on populated databases.
  - The libsql migrations bundle script now runs Prettier internally so the output is byte-stable across runs. A new CI step (`pnpm --filter @rawdash/adapter-libsql db:bundle && git diff --exit-code`) catches stale bundles.
  - `@rawdash/mcp`'s `trigger_sync` tool uses the new storage methods.
  - `@rawdash/nextjs.createRawdashClient` polls `/sync/state` (via the underlying data source) instead of `/health`.

### Patch Changes

- b893152: Add fast-check property tests for connector `sync()` invariants. Each connector now has a `property.test.ts` that generates synthetic API payloads from Zod schemas and asserts universal invariants (non-empty entity ids, finite event timestamps, no `undefined` reaching storage, no throws on any valid input) against `InMemoryStorage`. The reusable helper lives in the new internal `@rawdash/connector-test-utils` package.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 6e224af: Add `@rawdash/connector-linear` — syncs Linear teams, users, cycles, and issues into the six-shape storage model, plus state-transition events derived from each issue's history. Authenticates via a Personal API Key, supports incremental syncs (`updatedAt > since`), optional team scoping, and resumable phased pagination.
