# @rawdash/core

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 28355ff: Extend the `Connector.sync` contract with resumable progress: `SyncOptions.cursor?: unknown` carries opaque resumption state from the host, and `sync()` now returns `SyncResult = { done: boolean; cursor?: unknown }` so chunked syncs can hand control back to the host between pages.

  The github-actions connector now threads a `{ phase, pageUrl }` cursor through all paginated phases (workflow runs, pull requests, issues, deployments, releases) and checks `signal.aborted` at page boundaries. When the host signals a yield, the connector returns the in-progress phase + page URL instead of restarting from scratch on the next chunk — letting large GitHub backfills make forward progress under the cloud worker's subrequest budget.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- fe3e046: Expose the wire-body translator from `@rawdash/core`. `toWireConfig`, the `WireConfig` / `WireConnector` / `WireDashboard` types, and matching Zod schemas (`wireConfigSchema`, `wireConnectorSchema`, `wireDashboardSchema`) are now exported from `@rawdash/core` so backend implementations can produce and validate the canonical config wire body without re-implementing it. The CLI now consumes this from core instead of duplicating the translation internally.

### Patch Changes

- e42e3f8: Republish packages with `workspace:*` deps rewritten to real semver ranges. The publish workflow regressed in #59 and was emitting `"workspace:*"` literally into published `package.json` files, breaking installs for external consumers. The script now uses `pnpm publish` (which packs through pnpm's workspace-aware path) instead of `npm publish` directly.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 6fb7a7d: Consolidate libSQL storage into `@rawdash/adapter-libsql`.
  - New package `@rawdash/adapter-libsql` exporting `LibsqlStorage`, a `ServerStorage` backed by libSQL/Turso via Kysely. Works on Node and Cloudflare Workers from the same package.
  - Built-in schema migrations: Drizzle schema is the source of truth for `drizzle-kit generate`; runtime applies inlined SQL via a tiny applier (no `fs` / `fileURLToPath`, so Workers-safe).
  - Removed `@rawdash/core/libsql` subpath export — use `@rawdash/adapter-libsql` instead.
  - Removed `@rawdash/adapter-turso` — replaced by `@rawdash/adapter-libsql`.

- 9de7a5d: Rename public API types/interfaces/classes for clearer framework ergonomics. Drops noisy suffixes like `Ref`, `Entry`, `Def`, `Response`, and disambiguates several `Metric`-related types.

  Breaking renames:
  - `SecretRef` → `Secret` (and `isSecretRef` → `isSecret`, `resolveSecretRefs` → `resolveSecrets`)
  - `Metric` (data sample) → `MetricSample`
  - `MetricDef` → `Metric`
  - `ResolvedMetric` → `ComputedMetric` (and `resolvedMetricSchema` → `computedMetricSchema`)
  - `ConnectorEntry` → `ConfiguredConnector`
  - `WidgetEntry` → `CachedWidget`
  - `SyncRequest` → `SyncOptions`
  - `RawdashRouter` → `RouterMount`
  - `RawdashEngine` (client) → `ServerDataSource`
  - `RawdashClient` (nextjs) — removed; use `DataSource` directly
  - `RetryOptions` → `RetryPolicy`
  - `CredentialEntry` → `CredentialField`
  - `CredentialSchema` → `CredentialsSchema`
  - `RetentionCandidates` → `RetentionDeletionPlan`
  - `McpError` → `McpErrorPayload`
  - `RuntimeConfig` (mcp) → `McpRuntime`
  - `DiffSet<T>` → `Diff<T>`
  - `CloudConnectorEntry` → `CloudConnectorRecord`
  - `CloudDashboardEntry` → `CloudDashboardRecord`
  - `SecretEntry` → `CloudSecret`
  - `CloudConfigBody` → `CloudConfig`
  - `CachedWidgetResponse` → `CachedWidgetData`
  - `HealthResponse` → `HealthStatus`
  - `SyncTriggerResponse` → `SyncResult`

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- c70db8d: `resolveWidget` no longer requires an instantiated `ConnectorEntry[]`. The `connectors` parameter now accepts `ConnectorEntry[] | readonly string[] | undefined`:
  - `undefined` skips the membership check entirely — useful in runtimes (e.g. Cloudflare Workers) where connector implementations are not loaded on the read path.
  - `readonly string[]` checks membership against a lightweight allowlist of connector ids.
  - `ConnectorEntry[]` continues to work as before (backward-compatible).

### Patch Changes

- 13744df: Fix `resolvedMetricSchema`: make `field` optional (count-only metrics like `{ fn: 'count' }` have no field) and narrow `fn` from `z.string()` to `aggFnSchema` so consumers get the proper enum type and invalid fns are rejected at validation time.
- 2ca8591: Widen `@libsql/client` peer dependency range to `>=0.14.0 <1.0.0`. The `LibsqlStorage` API surface (`createClient`, `Client`, `execute`, `batch`, `transaction`) has been stable across 0.14 → 0.17, so the previous `^0.14.0` constraint was artificially narrow and produced peer-dep warnings for consumers on newer 0.x releases.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 725ea8a: Extract the widget engine into a runtime-neutral module in `@rawdash/core`.
  - `computeMetric`, `resolveWidget`, `InMemoryStorage`, and the `ServerStorage` interface now live in `@rawdash/core` and are re-exported from `@rawdash/server` for back-compat.
  - New `@rawdash/core/libsql` subpath export ships a `LibsqlStorage` adapter built on `@libsql/client/web` — runtime-neutral and Worker-compatible (no Node APIs, no drizzle migrator).
  - `widgetSchemas` (and new `widgetSchema`, `resolvedMetricSchema`, `filterClauseSchema`, `groupBySchema`, etc.) now describe the actual rich `Widget` discriminated union instead of using a placeholder `metric: z.string()`.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 0f069f7: **Breaking change**: `defineConfig()` no longer accepts a flat `widgets` map. Widgets are now grouped under named dashboards via `defineDashboard()`.

  **Before:**

  ```ts
  defineConfig({
    connectors: [{ connector: github }],
    widgets: {
      run_count: { metric: defineMetric({ ... }) },
    },
  });
  ```

  **After:**

  ```ts
  defineConfig({
    connectors: [{ connector: github }],
    dashboards: {
      github: defineDashboard({
        widgets: {
          run_count: { metric: defineMetric({ ... }) },
        },
      }),
    },
  });
  ```

  The widgets HTTP API is now dashboard-scoped: `GET /widgets` and `GET /widgets/:id` have been replaced by `GET /dashboards/:dashboardId/widgets` and `GET /dashboards/:dashboardId/widgets/:widgetId`. Widget IDs remain bare keys within their dashboard (e.g. `run_count_7d`); the dashboard is expressed via the URL path.
