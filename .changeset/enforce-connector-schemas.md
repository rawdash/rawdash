Enforce `static schemas` on every connector via the `ConnectorClass` contract.

`ConnectorClass` in `@rawdash/core` now requires a `readonly schemas: Readonly<Record<string, z.ZodType>>` map of resource name → Zod schema describing the raw API response shape. The keys must match the `resource` tag passed to `request()`. Building a `ConnectorRegistry` with a connector class that lacks `schemas` is now a TypeScript compile error.

The cloud baseline generator walks this map at deploy time to populate `connector_baselines`, which drives the shape-drift detection pipeline. Without `schemas`, the generator skipped every connector and the pipeline sat dormant; enforcing it at the type level prevents that from happening again.

All four shipping OSS connectors (`@rawdash/connector-github`, `@rawdash/connector-stripe`, `@rawdash/connector-linear`, `@rawdash/connector-google-analytics`) and `@rawdash/connector-sentry` now expose `static schemas` matching their full resource set. Property tests in each connector consume schemas via `runPropertySyncTest({ connectorClass, resource })`, so a dropped or misnamed key breaks that connector's own property tests in addition to failing typecheck at the registry site.
